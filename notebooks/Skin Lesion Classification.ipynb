    "models to include the validation dataset. Now, we see how well each of our models is able to \n",

    "* *Accuracy*: Another important evalution parameter is accuracy for this project. This is because \n",
    "we do not want to scare people by telling they are having harmful symptoms when they do not. \n",
    "So, we would like to have have as much correct predictions as we could."
